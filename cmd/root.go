	Use:   "goral",
	Version: "0.1.0-alpha",
	Short: "CRUD API generator for Go",
	Long: `Automatically generates Go code designed for REST-ish API generation
based on manifest files. With Goral entire back-end services can be generated
using a few configuration (manifest) files written in YAML/JSON.

Some features include:
 * Automatic struct generation for resources
 * Endpoint binding for web servers
 * SQL generation scripts for building the schema
 * Exporting TypeScript declarations
 * And much more...
 
Initialize a project/repository using "goral init" to scaffold the folder
structure and configurations. From there "goral add" will create new manifests,
and "goral build" will re-generate the Go files.

See "goral help" for more information on available commands and options.`,
